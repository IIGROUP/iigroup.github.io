Lab Introduction
------
<div style="font-size:16px;">
The Intelligent Interaction Group (IIGROUP) is affiliated with Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University. Our vision is to build intelligent systems that can interact with humans.  
<br><br>
Our current interests in intelligent interactive tasks include pre-training and post-training optimization techniques for large language models, reasoning, multimodal understanding and analysis, and generative AI technology. With applications including computer vision, natural language processing, AI safety, ML interpretability ‚Ä¢ and others.
