Lab Introduction
------
The Intelligent Interaction Group (IIGROUP) is affiliated with Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University. Our vision is to build intelligent systems that can interact with humans.  

Our current interests in intelligent interactive tasks include pre-training and post-training optimization techniques for large language models, reasoning, multimodal understanding and analysis, and generative AI technology. With applications including computer vision, natural language processing, AI safety, ML interpretability • and others.
