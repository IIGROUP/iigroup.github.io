Lab Introduction
------
<div style="font-size:16px;">
Affiliated with the <b>Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University</b>, the <b>Intelligent Interaction Group (IIGROUP)</b> is led by Professor Yujiu Yang. Our group is dedicated to advancing the frontiers of artificial intelligence under the motto: <b>"More intelligent, more interactive."</b><br><br>
Our research interests are broad and foundational, encompassing the full stack of modern AI. We focus on four primary pillars:
    <ol>
        <li>Fundamental AI Methods, including large-scale model training, deep learning algorithms, interpretability, and AI safety;</li>
        <li>Perception & World Modeling, with an emphasis on natural language processing, vision & spatiotemporal analysis, and multimodal intelligence;</li>
        <li>Reasoning & Generation, where we explore controllable generation systems, generative content creation, and deep reasoning;</li>
        <li>Action & Interaction, which investigates embodied AI agents and human-centric AI.</li>
    </ol>
